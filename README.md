# üóûÔ∏è Personalized Daily News Summarizer (RAG + LLM)

This project is a personalized news summarization app that uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to fetch, filter, and summarize daily news articles according to a user's interests and preferred summary style.

Check out the full report and deployment [here!](https://scottpitcher.github.io/#newsretrievalpage)

## üîç Overview
- Pulls recent news articles using public APIs or RSS feeds *(src/fetch_urls.py)*
  - **Scrapes** those articles *(scrape_full_articles.py)*
- **DOES NOT** chunk articles due to context issues within them; news articles tend to be short, so context window would not be hit *(src/embed_articles.py)*
- Retrieves only the **most relevant articles** based on your preferences 
- Summarizes them using a **customizable LLM-based summarizer** *(src/query_and_summarize.py)*
- **Automated** to re-run data fetching *(fetch_urls -> embed_articles)* scripts at UTC-Midnight for up-to-date data *(.github/workflows/refresh_news.yml)*
- **Collects user feedback** (üëç/üëé or rewrite requests) to adapt over time *(src/query_and_summarize_personalized.py)*
- Delivers clean, readable digests in your **preferred tone and format** *(src/rlhf_finetune.py)*

Example 3: Science

### 2. Custom Tone Adaption
The following guidelines were used to tune the model's summary delivery:
- **Factual with Context:** The summary must include key facts along with context, rather than just bare information.
- **Slightly Casual with Personality:** The tone should have a hint of casualness and personality without sacrificing professionalism.
- **Data-Driven:** Ensure the summary cites clear data points or uses factual evidence.

## üî® Roadblocks + Solutions
| Roadblock      | Solution                                  |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------|
|No inherent 'politics' category in NewsAPI|Created custom category using keyword search via the everything endpoint |
|LLM Output irrelevant to user query| Retrieved articles via semantic similarity (FAISS), applied a similarity threshold, and returned a fallback "unsure" answer if no context was strong enough|
|Bias transparency|**Potential addition(s)**: Keep database of sources with bias scores, train new agent to scan for bias and generate score.|
|Dated articles|**Potential addition(s)**: Implement system to weight articles via date, or omit after certain timeframe.|

<sub><i>*Note: all **potential additions** have not been added yet, and are stated to address gaps in project application.</i></sub>

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- üîé **Semantic Article Retrieval** using vector similarity (FAISS / Chroma)
- ü§ñ **Custom Summarization Styles** (bullet points, casual, academic, etc.)
- üì∞ **News API or RSS Integration** (e.g., NewsAPI, The Guardian)
- üì• **User Preference Profiles** (topics, style, summary length)
- üß† **LLM Integration** using OpenAI and transformer models
- üìä **Feedback Logging** for tone/style fine-tuning [In Progress...]

### üì• Example Usage

```bash
python main.py --user_profile config/user_1.json

```
### Roadblocks and Solutions
- Retrieving 3 articles, but only one relevant --> extract distance score and find threshold
